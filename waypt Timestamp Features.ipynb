    "This this is the code to generate the wifi features available in [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/devinanzelmo/indoor-navigation-and-location-wifi-features). Using these features can get a score below 14. For an example notebook using them see [this notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/devinanzelmo/wifi-features-lightgbm-starter). They only uses waypoints, wifi and timestamp data to generate solution. See this [forum post](https://www.kaggle.com/c/indoor-location-navigation/discussion/215445) for an outline of this solution method, and methods of improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are `break`'s inserted into loops which need to be removed to get this to run. Right now data is written to current working directory. This takes 2-4 hours to run depending on hard drive etc. There is a lot of room for improvement speeding up feature generation. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Update:** I added one line that creates a column for the path filename, this allows for a groupkfold crossvalidation. \n"
